# Machine Learning Engineer Test: Computer Vision and Object Detection

## Objective
This test aims to assess your skills in computer vision and object detection, with a specific focus on detecting room walls and identifying rooms in architectural blueprints or pre-construction plans.

This test evaluates your practical skills in applying advanced computer vision techniques to a specialized domain and your ability to integrate machine learning models into a simple API server for real-world applications.

Choose one of the visual tasks, one of the text extraction tasks, and the API Server task. We encourage you to submit your tests even if you canâ€™t complete all tasks.

Good luck!

## Features

- Upload PDF files containing floor plans or Image.
- Annotate walls or rooms based on user selection.
- Returns annotated images in PNG format.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- OpenCV
- pytesseract
- Other required libraries specified in `requirements.txt`

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wall-room-annotation-api.git
cd wall-room-annotation-api

## Usage
Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be running at http://localhost:5000.

Use curl or any API client (like Postman) to interact with the API.
## Example cURL
```
curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@test.pdf" "http://localhost:5000/run-inference?type=room" --output annotated_room_image.png
curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@test.pdf" "http://localhost:5000/run-inference?type=wall" --output annotated_room_image.png
curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@test.png" "http://localhost:5000/run-inference?type=room" --output annotated_room_image.png
```
